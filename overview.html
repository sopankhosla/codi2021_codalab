<h1>Backgroud</h1>
<p><span>Coreference and anaphora resolution is a long-studied problem in computational linguistics and NLP. Although
		multiple benchmark datasets have been developed in recent years, the progress in this area is hindered because
		most of these corpora often ignore the potentially difficult cases. For example, datasets like OntoNotes [1],
		GAP [2], and LitBank [3] only focus on identity coreference and ignore relations like discourse deixis [9] or
		bridging anaphora [10], both of which introduce interesting research challenges.</span></p>
<p><span>Several works have shown the importance of syntax for anaphora resolution [4,5,6,7]. However, these features
		might not generalize well to conversations where the language is often grammatically incorrect and suffers from
		disfluencies. Apart from this, anaphora resolution in dialogues requires systems to perform speaker grounding of
		pronouns and focus on long-term conversation structure, complexities that are often missing in news or Wikipedia
		articles which form a large chunk of current coreference resolution state-of-the-art datasets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This shared-task goes above and beyond the simple cases of coreference resolution that often overestimate the
		performance of current SOTA models on the task. The goal of this shared task is to bring together researchers
		from disciplines like discourse analysis, dialogue systems, machine learning, and linguistics and lead to
		advances in the area of coreference and anaphora resolution.</span></p>
<h1>Task</h1>
<p><span>In this shared task you will be building approaches/models for three anaphoric relations. The shared task is
		structured into three sub-tasks. You can participate in one or more of these sub-tasks. The three sub-tasks are
		below:</span></p>
<ol>
	<li>Resolution of anaphoric identity</li>
	<li>Resolution of bridging references</li>
	<li>Resolution of discourse deixis/abstract anaphora</li>
</ol>
<h1>Data</h1>
<p><span> The details of the data provided is as shown below.</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Training set: The training set will consist of annotated data for all three anaphoric relations. The data will
		be available under separate download links.</li>
	<li>Development set: The development set will consist of annotated data samples from different dialogic datasets
		with all three anaphoric relations ?</li>
	<li>Test set: The test set will be dialogue dataset from various sources.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Evaluations</h1>
<p><span>For evaluating the submissions, we use the MUC, B3, CEAFE, LEA scores. Furthermore, we also compare model's
		performance on both gold and predicted mentions to disentangle mention prediction and linking. Finally, we use
		MINA [8] as an additional evaluation.</span></p>
